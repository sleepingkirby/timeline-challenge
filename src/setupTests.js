I was told by Mumu Li that this challenge respected the interviewee's time and should be 1~2 hours. Having lead a team before and directed QA's, writing tests is an entire job.
One not to be taken lightly and one that takes and entire person to do, to do right, including edge cases, and usually 4~8 hours. Half an to an entire business day.
And entire business day is not 1~2 hours.
